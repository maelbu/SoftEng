We completed our unit testing by ensuring that each functional requirement had been tested.
We did not use a tool to do unit testing as we did not know this was a requirment. 
Our developer Maraya developed our functional requirments for the application. 
As she completed the development of functional requirments, our tester Lea followed up and tested those functional requirments.
